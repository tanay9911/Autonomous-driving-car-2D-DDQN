# How to Run the Self-Driving Car Simulation Using DDQN

This document outlines the steps required to set up and execute the autonomous driving car simulation powered by Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN).

## Prerequisites

To run this simulation, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. The project requires Python version 3.6 or newer.

## Required Dependencies

The following dependencies are necessary for successful execution:

### External Libraries
- **Pygame**
- **NumPy** 
- **TensorFlow**

### Standard Python Libraries (No installation required)
- **math**
- **collections**
- **random**
- **os**

## Installation

To install the required external libraries, run the following command in your terminal:
pip install pygame numpy tensorflow

### After extracting the  7.zip folder:
- Open the main_test_model.py file 
- Run the  main_test_model.py file
